00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.620
One morning, Leo, Ella, Zuri and Benny meet 
in the forest.

2
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.220
They find a red ball and, while playing, they all
try to grab it at the same time.
  
4
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.840
They argue about who should get to keep the ball.

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.660
Then Benny falls, and Leo feels guilty.

7
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.200
Ella comforts Benny, because 
real friends take care of one another.

8
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.840
That's when the four of them realize how important it

10
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.360
is to be kind, to share, and to think about others.

11
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.430
They play together with the ball, laugh, and feel happy

13
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.850
again, because when you share, everyone can have fun.
