Episode 1: Helping Friends

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.120
Hello, friends.
Oh, where are they going?

3
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.700
Ah, there they are.

4
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.380
Benny the bunny, Zuri the giraffe, 
and Leo the lion.

5
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.600
And here comes Ella the elephant.

7
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.760
Look at Ella, she's so excited.

8
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.940
She wants to show her friends something special.

9
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.659
What is she hiding behind her back?

10
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.980
Wow, a beautiful pink hat.

11
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.160
Ella tries it on right away.

12
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.360
But, oh no, the wind blows her hat
right off her head.

13
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.420
Ella becomes sad.

15
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.780
Her lovely new hat is gone.

16
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.340
'Don't worry' says Benny gently, 
'we'll help you find it.'

17
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.040
And off they go.

19
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.720
The friends start searching everywhere.

20
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.580
Leo looks behind the tree.

21
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.800
Ella looks inside the house and Zuri checks
behind the bushes.

22
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.020
Benny runs off to explore too.

24
00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:04.620
Here comes Leo again.

25
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.840
He's found something.

26
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.860
But, oh, it's just a yellow hat.

27
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.040
So the friends keep searching.

28
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.000
There comes Benny hopping back with something.

29
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.840
But his hat is orange.

30
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.020
That's not Ella's either.

31
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.800
Zuri arrives next, thinking she found the right one.

32
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.480
But that hat is green and Ella's was pink.

34
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.140
After all that searching, the friends still can't
find Ella's hat.

36
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.600
They don't know what to do and 
Ella loved her hat so much.

38
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.660
Then suddenly Leo remembers something.

40
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.680
He thinks he saw the hat blow forward
in the wind.
  
41
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.340
Everyone follows him, curious and hopeful.

43
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.700
And there it is, Ella's pink hat stuck

44
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.780
up in a tree.

45
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.920
Now they need to work together.

46
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.940
Benny carefully climbs onto Leo's shoulders and 
reaches up to grab the hat.

47
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.340
They did it!

49
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.540
Together!

50
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.580
Ella is so happy to have such wonderful
friends she can always count on.
